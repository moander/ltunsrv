# ltunsrv [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/moander/ltunsrv.png?branch=ltunsrv)](http://travis-ci.org/moander/ltunsrv) #

ltun.net exposes your lback.org to the world for easy testing and sharing! This is currently a clean fork of the localtunnel.me project, and are primarily for my personal use. 

This repo is the server component. If you are just looking for the CLI ltun app, see (https://github.com/moander/ltun)

## overview ##

The default ltun client connects to the ```ltun.net``` server. You can however easily setup and run your own server. I recommend you use the original server for your deployment, see (https://github.com/defunctzombie/localtunnel-server).
